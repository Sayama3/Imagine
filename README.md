# Imagine

A 3D RPG-Engine with world-building and city-building features, AI and other features to ease and automate the life of the Game Master.

The main goal of this application is to allow me to run Cyberpunk-based and Fantasy-based TTRPG with an application that

- simplify the process of creating maps
- automate the combat with AI features
- automate the process of patrolling for guarded area
- generate the name, background and inventory of character based on archetypes
- other features that I feel the need later on

It's basically a TTRPG Software made to answer my own need.
